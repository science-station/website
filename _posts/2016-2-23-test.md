If we consider that part of the theory of relativity which may nowadays in
a sense be regarded as bona fide scientific knowledge, we note two aspects
which have a major bearing on this theory. The whole development of the
theory turns on the question of whether there are physically preferred states
of motion in Nature (physical relativity problem). Also, concepts and distinctions
are only admissible to the extent that observable facts can be assigned
to them without ambiguity (stipulation that concepts and distinctions
should have meaning). This postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to
be of fundamental importance.

These two aspects become clear when applied to a special case, e.g. to classical
mechanics. Firstly we see that at any point filled with matter there exists
a preferred state of motion, namely that of the substance at the point considered.
Our problem starts however with the question whether physically
preferred states of motion exist in reference to extensive regions. From the
viewpoint of classical mechanics the answer is in the affirmative; the physically
preferred states of motion from the viewpoint of mechanics are those of
the inertial frames.

This assertion, in common with the basis of the whole of mechanics as it
generally used to be described before the relativity theory, far from meets
the above "stipulation of meaning". Motion can only be conceived as the
relative motion of bodies. In mechanics, motion relative to the system of
coordinates is implied when merely motion is referred to. Nevertheless this
interpretation does not comply with the "stipulation of meaning" if the coordinate
system is considered as something purely imaginary. If we turn our
attention to experimental physics we see that there the coordinate system is
invariably represented by a "practically rigid" body. Furthermore it is assumed
that such rigid bodies can be positioned in rest relative to one another
